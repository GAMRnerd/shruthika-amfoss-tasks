A) WHY MUST WE CHOOSE YOU?
*) I'd been passionate about coding since class 11 but having chosen sanskrit since I was in a dummy school which was integrated with AAKASH coding and the pressure of competitive exams, I never really had a chance to learn coding. Now that I ve come to college, I' d like to venture further into this field and work my level best to be an avid contributor to this club.Sitting for hours and learning new things gives me a lot of satisfaction and quenches my satiable curiosity :D

B) WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
*) I ve always been fascinated by web development but after the flutter workshop, I found that to be a really interesting platform as well. I'm a huge fan of anything that's aesthetically pleasing and also a detailed-oriented person. I would like to explore the various things I can do on these platforms.At the same time, im kinda competitive so I d be focusing on my academics as well.Hopefully, I shall maintain a balance.

C) HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
*) I'd try to contribute as much as I can to the club. Being a social butterfly has its benefits and I love engaging in group discussions.Whatever the case, I'd work as hard as I can.

D) DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
*) Positive ones only :) Having no technical background, I gained a lot of knowledge and expertise in various fields and there s so much more to discover. The seniors at the session too were really friendly, and all-in-all, I liked the fact that everyone over there was interactive. An atmosphere with like-minded people truly does motivate you to stop procastinating and get work done.
