Commands that I used for terminal hunt are:
1) cloning the repository : git clone
2) creating a new directory named 'solution' : mkdir solution
3) navigating to the file named 'solution': cd solution
4) creating file named 'part1.txt' : cat > part1.txt
5) copying a file : cp <file_name>
6) commiting a repository : git commit
7) displaying the contents of a file : cat -n <file_name>

The rest of the commands were given in the task details :)
