The sites i refered to in order to complete these tasks are 'https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-rust/' and 'https://oxylabs.io/blog/rust-web-scraping' 
I initially faced somewhat difficulty doing this since there was more than one than one class which was getting selected but then i used an adjacent sibling combinator and that did the job :)
